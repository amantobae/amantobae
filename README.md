# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi, I'm Amantai
I'm a software developer with a focus on mobile and systems programming. My main stack is Flutter & Dart — I build cross-platform mobile apps for iOS and Android, handling everything from UI design to API integration and state management.
On the lower-level side, I work with C++ and Raylib, developing games and desktop applications. I enjoy the control that comes with systems programming — writing game loops, rendering pipelines, and building things from scratch.
I also have backend experience: I've worked with Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, and MongoDB, building REST APIs and server-side logic. It's not my primary focus, but I know my way around a backend.
For tooling, I use Git for version control, VS Code as my go-to editor, and CLion for C++ projects.
